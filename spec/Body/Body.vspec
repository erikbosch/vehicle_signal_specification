Windshield.Wiping.UserControl:
  type: branch
  description: High Level signals typically available to user/driver to control wiper functionality
  
Windshield.Wiping.UserControl.Mode:
  datatype: string
  type: actuator
  allowed: ['OFF', 'SLOW', 'MEDIUM', 'FAST', 'INTERVAL', 'RAIN_SENSOR']
  description: Wiper mode requested by user/driver.
               INTERVAL indicates intermittent wiping, with fixed time interval between each wipe.
               RAIN_SENSOR indicates intermittent wiping based on rain intensity.

Windshield.Wiping.UserControl.Intensity:
  datatype: uint8
  type: actuator
  description: Relative intensity/sensitivity for interval and rain sensor mode as requested by user/driver.
               Has no significance if RequestedMode is OFF/SLOW/MEDIUM/FAST
               0 - wipers inactive.
               1 - minimum intensity (lowest frequency/sensitivity, longest intervals).
               2/3/4/... - higher intensity (higher frequency/sensitivity, shorter interval).
               Maximum value supported is vehicle specific.

Windshield.Wiping.SystemControl:
  type: branch
  instances: [Master, Slave]
  description: Low Level signals to control behavior of wiper system in detail.
               Master refers to the primary wiper system for the windshield.
               Slave, if present, refers to the secondary wiper system for the windshield.
  comment:     These signals are typically not directly available to the user/driver of the vehicle.
