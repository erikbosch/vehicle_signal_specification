# VSS Profiles

VSS is designed to be extensible.
A profile describes how VSS could be used for a specific purpose and defines extended attributes and/or extended nodes
used by that profile.

*Note: VSS-tools does not yet support addition of custom nodes!*

This section lists VSS profiles published either by COVESA VSS-project or by other project or organization.
They are not in anyway "approved" by COVESA, as of today there exist no "official" COVESA extensions.
If they become widely used they may however be promoted to official profiles in the future,
or even integrated into the official VSS syntax.
